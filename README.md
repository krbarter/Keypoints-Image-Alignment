# Keypoints Image Alignment

### This Image alignment algorithm takes two images and performs a keypoints based image assessment before aligning the first image over the second for a direct comparison.  This is a terminal only program which takes in a directory where the two Images are stored.  This program also outputs the total offset for use in other applications.
